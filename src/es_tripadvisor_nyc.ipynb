It is slightly different in terms of the menu, with less focus on pasta. It also has a slightly larger footprint with a small intimate bar, and has a very good wine and cocktail list.\n",

You really can't go wrong ordering everything on the menu but my last visit, I had them make me a simple pasta with tomatoes and basil.\n",
