      "Passage Text:\n",
      "It's surprisingly hard to find a good Italian restaurant in New York, given it's huge Italian population. I'm tired of \"Italian-American\" style overcooked pasta drowning in sauce. Thanks God Pisticci gets it right. Their pastas are very simple, but that's the key to Italian cuisine.\n",

      "This is a place to visit if you want to eat fast and you don't want a burger. Pastas are OK but it's a kind of a fast-food style cuisine in terms of taste and quality. It's an interesting option in New York from the price perspective.\n",
